            <h2>How Corporate Beer is Robbing America</h2>
            <img src="nodreams.jpg">
            <p>We are fighting to keep local economies thriving and beers diverse and tasty. Many a small craft brewery comes to a crossroads in its life where they must make the choice whether to keep the deliciousness contained or share the glory with the world. We believe in sharing our gifts, but corporate beer wants a piece of your pie. not only does it want a piece but it also wants to take over your factory and ruin your pies. Too often, have we seen great beers under the guise of their former label, pushed out by monsters like annheuser-busch with lackluster quality. This injustice needs to end. Write your congressman and open the distribution channels!</p>
